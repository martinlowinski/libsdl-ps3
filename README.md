Playstation3
------

libSDL participated in the Google Sumer of Code in 2009 and one project was to develop video support for Sonys Playstation3. Unfortunately, Linux is no longer supported (officially) on the PS3 and the code was removed from the master branch.

But it is still available via the Mercurial repository of libSDL:

    hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL
    hg checkout gsoc2009_ps3

`README.PS3` describes how to compile and install it. Have fun.
